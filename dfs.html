    <h2 class="w3-wide"> Depth First Search (DFS)</h2>
   
    <p class="w3-justify"> In this article, we will discuss the DFS algorithm in the data structure. It is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a tree data structure or a graph. The depth-first search (DFS) algorithm starts with the initial node of graph G and goes deeper until we find the goal node or the node with no children.
        <br>
        Because of the recursive nature, stack data structure can be used to implement the DFS algorithm. The process of implementing the DFS is similar to the BFS algorithm.
        <br><br>
        The step by step process to implement the DFS traversal is given as follows -
        <br>
        1. First, create a stack with the total number of vertices in the graph.<br>
        2. Now, choose any vertex as the starting point of traversal, and push that vertex into the stack.<br>
        3. After that, push a non-visited vertex (adjacent to the vertex on the top of the stack) to the top of the stack.<br>
        4. Now, repeat steps 3 and 4 until no vertices are left to visit from the vertex on the stack's top.<br>
        5. If no vertex is left, go back and pop a vertex from the stack.<br>
        6. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 until the stack is empty.</p>

    <h3>Applications of DFS algorithm</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        The applications of using the DFS algorithm are given as follows -<br><br>

- DFS algorithm can be used to implement the topological sorting.<br>
- It can be used to find the paths between two vertices.<br>
- It can also be used to detect cycles in the graph.<br>
- DFS algorithm is also used for one solution puzzles.<br>
- DFS is used to determine if a graph is bipartite or not.

    <h3>Algorithm</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        Step 1: SET STATUS = 1 (ready state) for each node in G<br>

        Step 2: Push the starting node A on the stack and set its STATUS = 2 (waiting state)<br>

        Step 3: Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until STACK is empty<br>

        Step 4: Pop the top node N. Process it and set its STATUS = 3 (processed state)<br>

        Step 5: Push on the stack all the neighbors of N that are in the ready state (whose STATUS = 1) and set their STATUS = 2 (waiting state)<br>

        [END OF LOOP]<br>

        Step 6: EXIT<br>

    <h3>Examples of DFS algorithm</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        Now, let's understand the working of the DFS algorithm by using an example. In the example given below, there is a directed graph having 7 vertices.<br>

  <div>
    <h3>Complexity of DFS algorithm</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        The time complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.<br>

The space complexity of the DFS algorithm is O(V).
