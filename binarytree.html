        The Binary tree means that the node can have maximum two children. Here, binary name itself suggests that 'two'; therefore, each node can have either 0, 1 or 2 children.

      <h3>Let's understand the binary tree through an example.</h3>
      <p class="w3-justify">
        <img src = "Screenshot 2023-04-04 at 11.59.55 PM.png"><br><br>
        The above tree is a binary tree because each node contains the utmost two children. The logical representation of the above tree is given below:<br><br>
        <img src = "Screenshot 2023-04-05 at 12.00.09 AM.png"><br><br>
        In the above tree, node 1 contains two pointers, i.e., left and a right pointer pointing to the left and right node respectively. The node 2 contains both the nodes (left and right node); therefore, it has two pointers (left and right). The nodes 3, 5 and 6 are the leaf nodes, so all these nodes contain NULL pointer on both left and right parts.

    <h3>Properties of Binary Tree</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        - At each level of i, the maximum number of nodes is 2i.<br>
        - The height of the tree is defined as the longest path from the root node to the leaf node. The tree which is shown above has a height equal to 3. Therefore, the maximum number of nodes at height 3 is equal to (1+2+4+8) = 15. In general, the maximum number of nodes possible at height h is (20 + 21 + 22+â€¦.2h) = 2h+1 -1.<br>
        - The minimum number of nodes possible at height h is equal to h+1.<br>
        - If the number of nodes is minimum, then the height of the tree would be maximum. Conversely, if the number of nodes is maximum, then the height of the tree would be minimum.<br>

    <h3>Types of Binary Tree</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        There are four types of Binary tree:<br><br>

        - Full/ proper/ strict Binary tree<br>
        - Complete Binary tree<br>
        - Perfect Binary tree<br>
        - Degenerate Binary tree<br>
        - Balanced Binary tree<br>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        So, that's all about the article. Hope the article will be helpful and informative to you.<br>

        This article was not only limited to the algorithm. Along with the algorithm, we have also discussed the binary tree compeletely and working.<br>
