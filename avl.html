    <p class="w3-opacity"><i></i></p>
    <p>AVL Tree is invented by GM Adelson - Velsky and EM Landis in 1962. The tree is named AVL in honour of its inventors.<br><br>

        AVL Tree can be defined as height balanced binary search tree in which each node is associated with a balance factor which is calculated by subtracting the height of its right sub-tree from that of its left sub-tree.<br><br>
        
        Tree is said to be balanced if balance factor of each node is in between -1 to 1, otherwise, the tree will be unbalanced and need to be balanced.<br><br>
        <h2>Balance Factor (k) = height (left(k)) - height (right(k))</h2>
        If balance factor of any node is 1, it means that the left sub-tree is one level higher than the right sub-tree.<br><br>

If balance factor of any node is 0, it means that the left sub-tree and right sub-tree contain equal height.<br><br>

If balance factor of any node is -1, it means that the left sub-tree is one level lower than the right sub-tree.<br><br>

An AVL tree is given in the following figure. We can see that, balance factor associated with each node is in between -1 and +1. therefore, it is an example of AVL tree.<br><br>

    <h3>AVL Rotations</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        We perform rotation in AVL tree only in case if Balance Factor is other than -1, 0, and 1. There are basically four types of rotations which are as follows:<br><br>

        1. L L rotation: Inserted node is in the left subtree of left subtree of A<br>
        2. R R rotation : Inserted node is in the right subtree of right subtree of A<br>
        3. L R rotation : Inserted node is in the right subtree of left subtree of A<br>
        4. R L rotation : Inserted node is in the left subtree of right subtree of A<br>
        5. Where node A is the node whose balance Factor is other than -1, 0, 1.<br>

The first two rotations LL and RR are single rotations and the next two rotations LR and RL are double rotations. For a tree to be unbalanced, minimum height must be at least 2

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">
        So, that's all about the article. Hope the article will be helpful and informative to you.<br>

        This article was not only limited to the algorithm. Along with the algorithm, we have also discussed the AVL and working.<br>
